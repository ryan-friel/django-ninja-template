# Project
The goal here was to examine django-ninja framework. It's basically a django friendly version of fastapi.

# Pros
The extensive use of type hinting was appreciated.
The simplicity of design was also nice.
After looking through the documentation it was fairly easy to ge a basic application up and running.
The application executes requests very quickly.

# Cons
Additional requirement that needs to be accounted for.
With anything new there is always a learning curve. Comparing this to standard Django Rest Framework there is a smaller learning curve.

# Setup
Currently the react app is very basic, and it is still in the process of being updated.
To run the django backend just navigate to project/backend/django_service/django_service.
Run the python manage.py runserver command.
Access the api endpoints at https://localhost:8000/api/ingredients
